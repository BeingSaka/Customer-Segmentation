## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to understand customer behavior.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Segmenting customers into **Low**, **Medium**, and **High** spending groups.
- **Results Export**: Segmentation results are saved in the `Clustering.csv` file.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Files
- **Mall_Customers.csv**: Contains demographic and spending data of mall customers.
- **Mall Clustering Project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook implementing the segmentation analysis.
- **Clustering.csv**: Exported results of customer segmentation with demographic information.
